This Ecommerce web app is designed on Angular + NodeJS + SQL Server.\n
Initially User can add items to Cart and when he/she wants to do check-out then user needs to Login/Register before accessing the check-out services.
At the time of User Registeration, he/she will be assigned as a role of User by default.So there are two routes of Adding/Editing/Deleting Products, Managing Orders are protected from him.
While User can access his my-Order list.
In Order to access those protected routes, Database Administrator can change the role of User to Admin.
